## The New Countryside

New energy technologies are providing opportunities for communities to create mutually beneficial relationships for waste reuse and clean energy production in partnerships with local manufacturing, agriculture and forestry to increase carbon capture and biotech job creation.  

<b>Objective</b> - Document new construction methods and clean energy technologies that allow energy resource centers to be integrated with nearby residential neighborhoods, walkable pastures, regenerative farming and robust foresty.  Explore sustainable industrial designs that emphasize a connection to nature, comfort and inclusion.
