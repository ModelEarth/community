## The New Countryside

New clean energy technologies are leading communities to create mutually beneficial relationships for waste reuse and clean energy production using output from local forestry, agriculture and manufacturing to increase carbon capture and biotech job creation.  

<b>Objective</b> - Document new construction methods and clean energy technologies that allow energy resource centers to be integrated with nearby residential neighborhoods, walkable pastures and robust foresty.  Explore sustainable industrial designs that emphasize a connection to nature, comfort and inclusion.
