# Industries by Zip Code (ZCTA)

Using the [ZIP Codes Business Patterns (ZBP) API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/cbp-nonemp-zbp/zbp-api.html), a new Python script can be created similar to our [BEA County API script](../../localsite/info/data/) to pre-processes zipcode level industry data while filling in gaps using state totals. Both counties and zip codes can be displayed in the [info page](../info/).  Here's an [industry map clustering sample](../../community/zip/leaflet/#columns=JobsAgriculture:50;JobsManufacturing:50).  

Using Python, combine with [uszipcode.readthedocs.io](https://uszipcode.readthedocs.io/01-Tutorial/index.html) demographics data, or pull from another source.    

Here's an older [prep all](../prep/all/) script with industries by zip code from spreadsheets with a random forest applied. 

Script for generating state centroids from TIGER data resides in:

Script resides in prep/industries/source

To run:  
sqlite3 industry.db < industry.SQL.txt > industry.OUT.txt  
First change the year in industry.SQL.txt  

### Data Sources

Due to the delay of 2017 Economic Census, the 2017 zip data became available in December of 2019. (The above script has not yet been updated and run for the 2017 data.)
