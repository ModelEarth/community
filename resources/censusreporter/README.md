# Census Reporter  

We'll be upgrading [Census Reporter zipcode demographic maps](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/86000US30308-30308/) to include [environmentally-enabled input-output](../../../io/charts/) widgets 
and [social safety net tools](https://www.codeforamerica.org/features/bringing-social-safety-net-benefits-online/).  

[Our Python 3 Fork](https://github.com/modelearth/map)  

### CensusReporter - Django - PostgreSQL

**Project**  
Use the Python 3 fork of CensusReporter to upgrade the US version and create an easy starting point for any country or state to integrate their demographic, industry and environmental data for analysis by machine learning algorithms.  

The Wazimap fork provides a Python 3 version of Census Reporter with international usage.  
We're aiming to bring it in sync with the Python 2 version used by [CensusReporter.org](https://CensusReporter.org).  

Start from our [github.com/modelearth/map](https://github.com/modelearth/map) fork of Wazimap Census Reporter.  
Wazimap is maintained by [OpenUp](https://openup.org.za/) and in used in Africa and India.  

Place Wazimap fork of CensusReporter into a [Python Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) for easier install.  
Place Census Reporter database into [PostgreSQL Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) with files for Docker secrets.

Set up Docker to [deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/datamade/how-to/blob/master/heroku/deploy-a-django-app.md) using a [containerization template](https://github.com/datamade/how-to/tree/master/docker/templates) (includes Django and Gatsby). Learn more [about using Heroku or AWS](https://datamade.us/blog/why-were-switching-to-heroku/).  

**Questions**  

CensusReporter simplifies the Census API. Is there a newer Census API's to integrate?  

During the process, how can we improve on the UI and performance of [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov).  CensusReporter has the advantage of generting static files. Let's create shorter URLs.  

How can demographics data, maps and machine learning be integrated around [social safety net programs](https://www.codeforamerica.org/features/bringing-social-safety-net-benefits-online/)?

**Areas for improvements**  
Zip and county maps  
Fast loading from pre-processed static files  
International contributions  
Sortable tables and lists below maps  

**React Interface**  
Expand upon the [EPA's Environmentally-Enabled IO Charts](../../../io/charts/) and integrate with community data portals.  



## Postgres Setup


Based on the [Wazimap Setup](https://wazimap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/started.html)  

Install postgres before you enter a virtual environment

	brew install postgres

Optional, if you need postgresql to be launched on login:

	To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
	  brew services start postgresql
	Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
	  pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start



## Virtual Environment Setup

Venv and Django with Postgres

These steps have not yet been tried here. Copied from PyAtl. These were successful with farmfresh scrapper.  

### Setup

Setup the environment:

`python3 -m venv .venv`

OSX / Linux:

`source .venv/bin/activate`

Windows:

`\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`


### Using venv

These are the original instrucions:  


This will install Python 3.7.3 (or latest) and create a subfolder called "env"   
--prompt is optional for showing a name before your terminal prompt.  
If your default is still python 2, then start commands with python3.  
<!-- Loren added 3 to python 3 below, just in case -->

	python3 -m venv ~/Documents/env1 --prompt MYTEST

Or if your are already in the folder where you're creating your environment...  
(Default directory on a mac is Users/[username].)  

	python3 -m venv env1

Exclude your virtual environment directory from your version control system by adding "env1" to .gitignore

Then activate. Your commands will then start with (env1):

	source ~/Documents/env1/bin/activate

Command above differs for bash/zsh. Note that \~/Documents/ is not included here:  

See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html  

Upgrade pip to 20.0.2+ since 19.0.3 is system default:

	pip install --upgrade pip

## Django

Installs Django 3.0.3

	pip install django
	django-admin startproject wazimap_ex
	cd wazimap_ex
	rm wazimap_ex/urls.py wazimap_ex/wsgi.py

Install GDAL

	brew install gdal --HEAD

Had one error out of many successful. Appears to have built from mpc-1.1.0.tar.gz source:

	==> Pouring mpfr-4.0.2.catalina.bottle.tar.gz

You'll need to have PostgreSQL installed first above.  

**Question:** Can we modify so it's not necessary to install PostgreSQL, and only use the API?  

	pip install wazimap

Results with successfully installed Django-2.2.6

See [Step 6](https://wazimap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/started.html) about how to change your settings.py file.

Step 7 - If "createuser -P wazimap" results in error, restart postgresql in another terminal:  

	brew services restart postgresql

You may want to [install DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) SQL Database tools.  

On Mac, first  install the latest version of Java:  

	brew cask install adoptopenjdk --no-quarantine
	brew cask install dbeaver-community

<!--
	If unable to open DBeaver app, try
	brew cask install adoptopenjdk --no-quarantine

	Source:
	https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/homebrew-openjdk/issues/267
-->

DBeaver shortcuts

	Run SQL script: Alt+X
	Run only part of a SQL script: Ctrl+Enter
	You can turn on/off the right panels: F7

	You can generate SQL statements (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) based on selected rows. To generate SQL, right-click the selected rows, then click Generate SQL and select one of the SQL commands you see.


## Django Troubleshooting

Trying to get site to appear at: http://localhost:8000/admin  
[Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/)

	django-admin startproject mysite
	cd mysite
	python3 manage.py runserver

Stop dejango site

	Ctrl-C

When you're done with the virtual environment

	deactivate
