# Start a Website   

Whether on your local machine, or for your local community, these steps will get you started creating a static site using markdown with GitHub for free hosting.  

## 1. Start a localhost server on your computer

Go to the folder where you'd like your webroot to reside and run the following to view pages on localhost:

	python -m http.server 8887

 Or run anywhere and include a path to your webroot. Change /Sites to your custom path:

 	python3 -m http.server 8887 -d /Sites

You'll need to run this command to start localhost whenever you restart your computer.

 Alternatively, you can install [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) to view and develop pages offline using https://localhost:8777 on your computer. Web Server for Chrome also allows you to [load a custom domain](https://medium.com/@jmatix/using-chrome-as-a-local-web-server-af04baffd581). Web Server for Chrome does not work as a Brave browser extension on Mac (as of December 2019), but you can add as a Chrome extension, then utilize from within Brave.

## 2. Clone the "localsite" repo into your webroot 

Go to the <a href='https://github.com/localsite/localsite/'>localsite</a> repo and click "Code"

Choose "Open with Github Desktop" to pull down using <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>.  

Save the file in the webroot folder you created in step 1.  

A static page should now be visible at [http://localhost:8887/localsite/](http://localhost:8887/localsite/)  
An industry impact widget is embedded on the page.  


React developers: You might also want to clone the 
<a href='https://github.com/modelearth/useeio-widgets'>useeio-widgets</a> repo to edit the widget code directly.

We also encourage you to help us maintain the <a href='https://github.com/modelearth/community/'>community</a> and <a href='https://github.com/modelearth/io/'>io</a> repos.

## 3. Deploy your updates

Deploy your updates using GitHub. If you are not a project collaborator, GitHub Desktop will prompt you to create a project fork on GitHub. Place a pull request when your updates are ready for review.  

<!--
- <a href='https://github.com/modelearth/io'>io</a> - overview
- <a href='https://github.com/georgiadata/smartdata'>smartdata</a> - data

A 404 error will occur for the private smartdata folder if you are not a collaborator. 
-->

<!--
## 4. Update markdown pages

Add notes and links in the README.md files which are pulled into index.html pages.  

- [Bioeconomy Planner - BEA](../../bea)  
- [Industry Impact](../../industries)  
- [Localization - Places](../../places)  
-->

<!--
## 5. Update dataset layouts

Use a Google Sheet or CSV file to [prototype a list or chart](../dataset) and update [EEIO Widgets](https://modelearth.github.io/io/charts/) that load from JSON files generated by the USEEIO API.  
-->

<!--
1. [Set up crowdsourced editing](../../../crowdsource/editor) of data for lists and maps.

1. Copy the "starter" folder inside community and give it the name of your community or module.
-->


### Mac Users
To avoid commiting your local .DS\_Store files to GitHub, you may need to run the following to ignore .DS\_Store files during commits forever. The .DS\_Store files will continue to set icon sizes in your local file manager.   
 
<!-- Avoid .DS_Store file creation over network connections (article from 2011, confirm this still occurs)
	https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1629 -->
	git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore  
	echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore

If you encounter the error "xcrun: error: invalid active developer path", [install the Xcode toolkit](https://ma.ttias.be/mac-os-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path-missing-xcrun/) first.  

You can toggle hidden file viewing using Command+Shift+Dot, .DS_Store will not be displayed. 
To fix a conflict you may need delete the .DS_Store within the Github.com website.  


## 4. Activate your website

### How to host multiple repos in one site using Github Pages - without using subdomains

- Use CloudFlare.com as a free proxy for your domain name
- Important: Avoid adding the 4 Google A records (these prevent adding the CNAME record)
- Add a CNAME record in CloudFlare with @ and [github username].github.io
- Create a public repo called [github username].github.io
- Activate GitHub Pages and add your custom domain name.
- Wait a couple minutes for new GitHub Pages site to become available.
- Activate GitHub Pages for each additional repo. These can be forks from other accounts.  
<!-- note, when setting up the prior neighborhood folder was renamed to [github username].github.io -->


## 5. Update your forked repos

### Occasionally merge in updates from the master (source) repo by doing a "pull request"

On your forked repo: Click Compare > switching the base (if you have not switched already) > Create pull request > Give the pull request a title > Create pull request (again) > Merge pull request (scroll down) > Confirm merge.
