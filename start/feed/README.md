#Publish Your Inventory

###Share your Product Availability and Publish a Materials Wishlist

[Send Us Links](add) to include your inventory of vaccine availability or other items and your wishlist of needed items (including reusable, shared and recycled).  If you don't have an existing server to host your files, we'll help you post your listings for free using GitHub.  

Post as CSV files using the following Google Merchant Center standard:  
[entity1\_inventory.csv](entity1_inventory.csv) and [entity1\_wishlist.csv](entity1_wishlist.csv)  

Replace "entity1" with a short lowercase name (handle) for yourself or your organization.  
Use dashes or underscores instead of spaces.  

We'll generate embeddable lists that you can also display in your own website.  

<b>Examples of items to list:</b>  
Vaccine Availability    
Rocks, slate, bricks  
Byproducts of farming  
Byproducts of food and beer production

###Bonsai Data Storage

[The Bonsai approach](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bonsai/wiki/Data-Storage) with 
[RDF and JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/wiki/RDF_AND_JSON-LD_UseCases) could be researched, but without a content management system interface, it may be too complex for small merchants to use.
