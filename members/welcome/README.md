# Welcome!

Thanks for your interest in joining DreamStudio's Model.Earth data science team!  

We require that volunteers contribute to code development for a couple weeks before providing an OPT volunteer welcome letter. Ongoing code contributions are required each month to remain active on our [Member List](../).

Our weekly Google Meet link is always the same: [model.earth/io/coders](https://model.earth/io/coders)

We encourage OPT volunteers to also focus on their search for paid positions. We're creating automated portfolio pages for our active members.

We ask that participants not list us on their resume or LinkedIn until they've been actively contributing updates for a few weeks. Your contributions to our team projects provide a basis for assessment if job interviewers contact us to confirm ongoing participation.

**IMPORTANT:** We only provide letters of experience to participants who make coding contributions made using Github Pull Requests and Colabs. Email is the main way we plan and track progress. After contributing to our Run Models Colab, submit a RealityStream repo PR containing a backup of the colab or send details in an email.

Find projects that fit your goals on our [Active Projects page](../../../projects) and [Github List](https://github.com/modelearth/projects/issues). 


1. [Register in Democracy Lab](https://www.democracylab.org/projects/834) as your first step. Loren will email you a link to our Discord channel where you can share updates and help others.

2. Send Loren an email with a link to the [Model.Earth projects on GitHub](https://github.com/modelearth/projects/issues) you're interested in. Loren will add you to the issue's description. 

3. Please immediately post your deployment date objectives on the issue page, and return to edit your existing post with frequent progress updates. Also share updates in our Discord. Add add helpful notes and documenation in README files in the code you contribute to.

4. Once you've contributed your first awesome addition, remind Loren to send you our official Welcome letter.

Thanks for your interest! Our goal is to create open source tools that are helpful to you well beyond your volunteer participation. We cover the full spectrum of coding and can engineer projects to fit your expertise and learning goals to help build your resume.
