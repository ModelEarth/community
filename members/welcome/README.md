We ask that participants not list us on their resume or LinkedIn until they've been actively contributing updates for a few weeks. Your contributions to our team projects provide a basis for assessment if job interviewers contact us to confirm ongoing participation.

**Select Projects:** Add your name after a TO DO you're interested in on our [Active Projects Page](../../../projects), or edit README pages and CoLabs. Send a PR to add yourself to a project and add notes in our README files as you contribute code.

**Active OPT Volunteers:** To remain active as an OPT volunteer, please contribute at least one Pull Request (PR) per week.  The time commitment is significant as the OPT program requires 20+ hours per week.  As you update code, also edit README files throughout our repos. Add status updates and deployment steps for others, correct existing notes and add new documentation.

**Steps for pulling down our repos:** [Fork and clone related repos](../../../localsite/start/steps/) - Turn on Github Pages for both your fork of the repo and your fork of the [localsite repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite/). When submiting a PR, also send an email include a review link. Your review link will be: [youraccount].github.io/[therepo] 

Send an email whenever you send a pull request. If you are uncertain about an edit, make your best guess and submit the PR anyway. Include any uncertainties in the email you send after submitting the PR.
