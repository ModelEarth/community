<h2 style="margin-top:0px">Background</h2>
<p>
From 2015-2018, the Center of Innovation for Energy partnered with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) and the Georgia Recycling Coalition to develop a
  Georgia version of the USEEIO model.
</p>

<p>
  In late 2019, EPA awarded a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/research/regional-sustainability-and-environmental-sciences-research-program-reses">Regional Sustainability and Environmental Sciences Research Program (RESES)</a> grant
(Community-driven Application Development Using USEEIO Models) to support EPA and the Center of Innovation for Energy to work with Georgia communities to build their own interfaces to the GA model.
  Georgia will be the first state to have this model.
</p>

<p>
  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), GA Department of Economic Development Center for Innovation for Energy,
  and Georgia Tech are working with Georgia communities to evaluate economic and environmental outcomes of new technologies,
  investments, and regional industries through web applications. These applications will address community concerns by combining a Georgia version of the USEEIO model with local data to add detail to the evaluation.​

<h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>
<h3>The community applications will support two primary audiences. It will:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Help industries achieve their sustainability goals and improve profitability.</li>
<li>Help communities understand what their assets are and use them to attract new industries.</li>
</ol>
