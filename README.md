### You can participate on multiple teams!

Projects use the EPA's [Environmentally-Enabled Input-Output widgets](https://model.earth/io/charts)  


## I. Google Data Commons API

[Install Data Commons Lite](../localsite/info/data/datacommons/) on your local computer.  

Find and pull US census data by state and county from the Google Data Commons API.  Look for commute times.  

Pull Walkability data from one of the free API's services that provide Walk Scores, Transit Scores and Bike Scores: [RapidAPI.com](https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/walk-score/details) or [WalkScore.com](https://www.walkscore.com/professional/api.php)  

Add an "[Environment > Impact](https://datacommons.org/place/country/USA?topic=Environment)" section to Google Data commons using the [EPA IO Widgets](../../io/charts/).  

Use and improve the Google Data Common's checkbox heirarchy - [sample](https://datacommons.org/tools/timeline#place=zip%2F30318&statsVar=Count_Person_5To17Years_BornInOtherStateInTheUnitedStates%2C0%2C6%2C1%2C1%2C0__Count_Person_60To61Years_BornInOtherStateInTheUnitedStates%2C0%2C6%2C7%2C1%2C0%2CCount_Person__Count_Person_5To17Years_BornInStateOfResidence%2C0%2C6%2C1%2C1%2C1__WagesAnnual_Establishment%2C9%2C0__Count_Establishment%2C9%2C2&chart=%7B%22count%22%3A%7B%22pc%22%3Afalse%7D%7D)  

Add highlighted colors similar to BEA  
[View sample](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=150&step=3&isuri=1&table_list=5013&categories=compbyind), click Table > Bar Chart and choose industries.  

Analysis applied to <a href="projects/mobility/">industries impacted by the transition to EV</a>.  

<!--
Find existing widgets and repos that use the [Charging Station API](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC). Perhaps the [Open Charge Map API](https://openchargemap.org/site/develop/api) and/or [TomTom](https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api-documentation/ev-charging-stations-availability).
--> 

## II. Python Machine Learning

### Python Flask, Javascript, Leaflet Maps

Predicting outcomes from changes to collections of industries and transitions within industry groups.  

COLAB-orating with San Diego: [mcmorgan27/sd-business](https://github.com/mcmorgan27/sd-business/tree/1b22ef0e9231f0d2bcfafcff41e69c9adc9038fd)

Sample of embedded [Choropleth Map for Entire Automotive Industry](https://model.earth/localsite/info/#show=vehicles&indicators=VADD&naics=326199,336390,325211,326112,336412,333111,336211,336340,336370,336413,336320,335911,336360,331110,335912,331221,336111,336330&count=20) using DataUSA.io widget displaying American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample [PUMS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata/mdat.html) data.  
<!--
1. Finalize csv output for counties by state using [BLS data from EPA Flowsa](/localsite/info/data/) - scroll down in page.  Merge columns and save in state folders.  
-->
1. [Set-up Flask server](/localsite/info/data/) using DataCommon.org "tools" repo sample.  

1. Document setting up a public website using the Machine Learning Websocket in the first project sample below.

1. Create cool map output with code from our existing Machine Learning projects:  
- [Impact map (Machine Learning Websocket)](/io/impact/)  
- [JS clustering (Machine Learning Javascript)](/community/zip/leaflet/#columns=JobsAgriculture:50;JobsManufacturing:50)
- [Simple Choropleth](/community/map/income/) and [More maps](/community/start/maps/)


<!--
1. Contribute a USSEIO Widget to the [DataUSA.io](https://datausa.io/) GitHub repos.

1. Test output normalization for [Sankey chart](../io/charts/sankey/) using the [USEEIO API Examples](/community/resources/useeio/)

1. Output [All the Places](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/) into zip folders. Save in [zip/io/data](https://model.earth/zip/io/) folders where demographics .json and .md files reside.

1. Expand upon [county-based results](../localsite/info/) to provide zipcode-based industry lists. - [Details](industries) 

1. Create and update scripts that pull data and pre-process into csv and json files for [industry zip code searches](industries/) and [local commodity searchs](/localsite/info/data/).  

1. Industry Level Estimates for Counties and Zipcodes. Fill in gaps when only the number of establishments is provided at the state level - [Details](../localsite/info/data/)  

1. Update CSV files on employment and industries for D3 charts using [Census industry data](industries) and [income by zipcode (zcta)](prep/all). 
-->
<!--[projections](prep/regression/)-->

<!--
1. Work with the [USEEIO API](https://github.com/usepa/useeio_api/wiki/Use-the-API) and update [Input-Output charts](../io/charts/). Widgets are loaded from JSON files generated from the [USEEIO API endpoints](https://s3.amazonaws.com/useeio-api-go-swagger-staging/index.html) on AWS for Goods & Services demand vectors (Food System and Full System).  

1. Update [Django Census Reporter](resources/censusreporter) by staring with the Python 3 Wazimap [fork](resources/censusreporter) used in Africa and India. Integrate US demographic data from Python 2 version. Set up Docker to [deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/datamade/how-to/blob/master/heroku/deploy-a-django-app.md) using a [containerization template](https://github.com/datamade/how-to/tree/master/docker/templates). Learn more [about using Heroku or AWS](https://datamade.us/blog/why-were-switching-to-heroku/).  
-->

## III. GitHub Actions Automation

Generate static files to drive Data Commons navigation. Crosswalk zipcodes and counties to PUMA regions. This crosswalk resides in DataUSA.io Github repo.  

DONE - State Dropdown. Kathryn Winglee has updated our [R-Language script](../community-data/us/) to output dropdown list attributes for [map zoom](../localsite/info/).  

DONE - Kathryn Winglee created files for all US zip codes.  She used the [uszipcode programmable database (Python)](https://uszipcode.readthedocs.io/01-Tutorial/index.html) - [Github](https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/uszipcode-project) to generate [a data file for each zip code](https://model.earth/zip/io/#zip=30310). Here's the [processing script](https://github.com/modelearth/zip/tree/master/io).

DONE - Kathryn Winglee updated R-Language script to sort states alphabetically. For non-state, add state="false" attribute.

DONE - Pull Data to GitHub. Abrie fixed the [Vaccine dosage pull to GitHub](https://github.com/bbrewington/ga.dph.data/pull/1), now we need to [push into a Google Sheet](https://www.google.com/search?q=Github+Actions+send+data+to+Google+Sheet&oq=Github+A[…]et&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.20842j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).  

All the Places - Output [All the Places](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/) into zip folders. Save in [zip/io/data](https://model.earth/zip/io/) folders where demographics .json and .md files reside.  

Pull over demographics reporting interface from [CensusReporter](resources/censusreporter). Retain ability to point at existing PostGreSQL backend while adding ability to pull from Google Data Commons.   


## IV. Crowdsource Editor - Google REST App

1. Google Sheet Crowdsource Editor - A REST process allowing editors to return and update their own row contributions.

1. Work with a [JAMstack Editor](https://headlesscms.org/) to edit CSV files directly on GitHub using social logins. 

1. [Google Sheet Editor](../editor) for crowdsourcing updates. Code for America Brigades often use Google Sheets to maintain directories, like these maps: [Georgia](https://www.georgia.org/covid19suppliersmap) and [North Carolina](https://nccovidsupport.org/). A social login process is needed to allow contributors to return and update their own Google sheet row data through an online form, without having access to edit rows of other contributors. The set-up needs to take only a minute per sheet, so avoid Zapier or other time-intensive approaches.


## V. React - Input-Output Sankey Chart

### React and USEEIO JSON

1. Update the [Sankey D3 Chart](../io/charts/sankey/) data formatting to use the same process as the [USEEIO inflow-outflow widget](../io/build/slider.html#sectors=333613,335912,336111&page=1&count=10).  

1. View info on [editing EPA IO widgets](/io/charts/).

1. See sample [visualizations](start/charts/) of material flow charts.

1. Normalization input and output so sides of Sankey are even.

<!--
And/or <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/">Apollo</a> GraphQL for faster dev than the point-to-point nature of REST endpoints.

## VI. React - Last Airbender Interface

### React and Material UI

1. Contribute to our [AWS Amplify React](../aws/amplify/) repo by activating [Last Airbender indicator sets](../io/charts/inflow-outflow/).  


1. Update EPA's <a href="../io/charts/">Embeddable IO Widgets</a> generated from [USEEIO API](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API) local .json data.  
<!--Auto-select all categories in center column when populated from naics values.-->  


<div class="popout">
<h3>Last Airbender Interface</h3>

<p>We're developing a <a href="../../io/charts/inflow-outflow/#sectors=326210&page=1&count=10">Friendly Inflow-Outflow Interface</a> for grouping EPA indicators by Air, Water, Land, Energy, Wealth and Health.  
Find cool Material UI interfaces that could be applied to our category set menu.</p>

<p>
The category set json resides in docs/static/json thanks to Alikah within our <a href="https://github.com/modelearth//amplifyapp">AmplifyApp</a> which is a great place to learn React.

<a href="../aws/amplify/">We've documented AWS Amplify set up steps</a>.

<!--as Primary and Secondary columns in <a href="../community-data/us/indicators/LCIA_Indicator_sets.csv">LCIA_Indicator_sets.csv</a> and in the [Bio-Modeling Branch](https://github.com/modelearth/useeior/blob/Bio-Modeling/inst/extdata/USEEIO_LCIA_Indicators.csv).
