1. [Google Sheet Editor](https://neighborhood.org/editor) for crowdsourcing updates. Code for America Brigades often use Google Sheets to maintain directories, like these maps: [Georgia](https://www.georgia.org/covid19suppliersmap) and [North Carolina](https://nccovidsupport.org/). A social login process is needed to allow contributors to return and update their own Google sheet row data through an online form, without having access to edit rows of other contributors. The set-up needs to take only a minute per sheet, so avoid Zapier or other time-intensive approaches.

# Specific Project Tasks

Maintain a list of your time contributions to increase your award potential!  
[Let us know](../localsite/info/input/) what you're working on to avoid overlaps.  

## Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) API

County automobile industry employment for 6-digit NAICS 336111.
4-digit NAICS resides in "By-Industry" link [here](https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm), but we will be pulling from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)&nbsp;API. 

## Choropleth map using multiple inputs

We'll be creating a choropleth map of 
<a href="../projects/mobility/">industries impacted by transition to EV</a><br>

Starting points [impact map](/io/impact/) and [JS clustering](/community/zip/leaflet/#columns=JobsAgriculture:50;JobsManufacturing:50)

## State Map Zoom

Kathryn Winglee is making this update. 
- [Update R-Language script](../community-data/us/) to output dropdown list attributes for map zoom.




## Bubble Chart

D3 - [View Widget](../io/charts/bubble/) 

- Modify so popups still appear when the containing div is set to position:relative. 
- Scale to size of containing div during browser resize.
- Set the default bubble color to red for more pop.
- Omit red from the scale when other [bubbles are highlighted](../localsite/info/).  
- Create React version.  

## Industry-List and Heatmap Mosaic

React - [View Widget](../io/build/sector_list.html?view=mosaic&count=50) - [All Widgets](../io/charts/) 

- When column selected, avoid dimming other columns.  
- React javascript is too big (2MB and growing). Split out widgets.     
- Include tabs at top: 20 categories, 388 industry sectors, X selected - [mock up](start/dataset/)
- Show list of selected sectors under "X selected" tab. Include duplicate checkboxes in "X selected" tab.  
- Display parent NAICS industry categories that open to reveal subcategories
- Display the quantity selected after each parent category title in parenthesis

- Toggle matrices using a dropdown menu to select a matrix
- List by parent category.
- Include menu with options: Alphabetical, Show values 
- Show values like [sortable example](https://model.earth/community/start/dataset/sortable.html)
- Include verticle column name like [dataset example](https://model.earth/community/start/dataset/)
- Highlight an "Action" menu when checkboxes are clicked
- Actions could include: Display on map, Display bar chart, Generate Report

Additional updates:  

1. Place "id" and "title" columns first. (Split "Sectors" column and remove.)
2. Omit decimal places from dollar values.
3. Parse ID to add a "main\_category\_id" column. Use a 2 digit number to keep CSV file small.  
4. Retain capital letters at start of words in section titles.
5. Add Input-Output total dollar values.  

## Inflow-Outflow Chart

[Inflow-Outflow Chart](../io/charts/inflow-outflow/#sectors=326210&page=1&count=10) - 
<a href="../io/build/slider.html#sectors=322130,327910,541200&page=1&count=10">Widget only</a> - 
<a href="../io/charts/">All Widgets</a>

Add Airbender visuals.  

Prevent multiple stepping backing-up by avoiding saving history with each hash change.  

<!--
The bar could turn green when a commodity has been increased from its default.  
The bar could turn red when a commodity has been decreased from its default.

<!--
## Impact Bar Chart

React - [View Widget](../io/build/impact_chart_config.html#sectors=334111,334210,334220&perspective=direct&analysis=Consumption) - [Details](../io/charts/) 


- Create an example with three columns and one impact area per colums.  
- Display sector titles to the left of the first column.
- Display sector name over each bar.  
- Display description of each indicator
- Update for use with Darkly bootstrap, similar to [bubble chart](../io/charts/bubble) - click bubble to view impact chart.  
-->

## Last Airbender

For use as an [elementary school education interface](../../io/charts/inflow-outflow/#sectors=326210&page=1&count=10), the EPA indicators are being organized by Air, Water, Land, and Fire (Energy), Prosperity (Economy) and Health.  

The Airbender categories have been added as Primary and Secondary columns in [LCIA_Indicator_sets.csv](../community-data/us/indicators/LCIA_Indicator_sets.csv) and in the [Bio-Modeling Branch](https://github.com/modelearth/useeior/blob/Bio-Modeling/inst/extdata/USEEIO_LCIA_Indicators.csv).  

Here’s an [Airbender API](https://last-airbender-api.herokuapp.com/) for relating the four “nation” categories to characters.  

## Use of BEA commodities to estimate null industries

To protect the privacy of individual firms, the census omits payroll and empolyee count data for some industries at both the state and county level (like Automobile Manufacturing).  For Georgia, there are [89 industries](../community-data/us/state/ga/industries_state13_naics6_0s.tsv) with only the number of establishments available at both the county and state lever. 

The estimates for these omitted industry values could be generated using the state BEA commodity data with the crosswalk file, or an average from other states could be used (as long as each industry has at least one payroll value in another state).
