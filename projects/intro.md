<!--
The Better Civic Site implementation uses Drupal, Django and ERPNext to provide rapidly deployable, disposable backends that allow for easy contributions by volunteers and contractors.

Neighborhood.org themes include Marvel Comics and the Last Airbender. We're extending the [DemocracyLab](https://democracylab.org) project tools to add [voting tools](https://github.com/kevmoo/vote.dart).

We're integrating the project index tools that Code for America is creating from Italy’s meta-tag editor, and include both login.gov and BrightID login’s for unique user validation.
