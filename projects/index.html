      To establish a mature, native forest in ten times the normal rate of forests planted by humans, amend the soil to a depth of one meter, add a locally abundant biomass. Plant three to five saplings per square meter. "This grows into a forest so dense that after eight months, sunlight can’t reach the ground. At this point, every drop of rain that falls is conserved, and every leaf that falls is converted into humus. The more the forest grows, the more it generates nutrients for itself, accelerating further growth. This density also means that individual trees begin competing for sunlight — another reason these forests grow so fast."<br><br>

      <h2>Nanowood Insulation, Densified Superwood and Transparent Wood</h2>

        Low-land areas with abundant water are ideal for the fast growth of softwood used in the production of nanowood insulation, densified super wood, and transparent wood - which capture and store carbon locally in construction and manufacturing.<br><br>

              Nanowood is produced by boiling out the lignin, treating with Hydrogen Peroxide, then freeze-drying the remaining pure cellulose.

      Carbon capture varies widely based on the final use of wood pellets for fuel. 
      The European energy industry is using subsidies to outbid the US wood construction and biochemical industry for biomass, which includes low-value whole trees, branches and waste wood chips.

      Green process converts almost any carbon source into graphene</a><br>
      "Graphene is the strongest known material. It is comprised of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, in which one atom forms each vertex. A tiny amount of graphene can significantly enhance the properties of materials such as plastics, paints, composites, wood composites, concrete, metals, and lubricant. However, it is expensive to manufacture."<br><br>
