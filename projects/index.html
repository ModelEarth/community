      <h2>In Paper Production</h2>

      The expanse of the global lignin market is being driven by the increasing demand for carbon fibers in the construction and automotive industries.  <a href="https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/judge-rules-for-rayonier-in-altamaha-pollution-case/article_2ee33a04-7d24-52c2-9184-e8980eb8ae39.html">Paper&nbsp;mills</a> currently discharge million of gallons of lignin effluent into waterways daily. 
      Lignin is an organic, often pale-yellow, connecting substance found between and in plant cells.

      To establish a mature, native forest in ten times the normal rate of forests planted by humans, amend the soil to a depth of one meter, add a locally abundant biomass. Plant three to five saplings per square meter. "This grows into a forest so dense that after eight months, sunlight can’t reach the ground. At this point, every drop of rain that falls is conserved, and every leaf that falls is converted into humus. The more the forest grows, the more it generates nutrients for itself, accelerating further growth. This density also means that individual trees begin competing for sunlight — another reason these forests grow so fast."<br><br>

              Nanowood is produced by boiling out the lignin, treating with Hydrogen Peroxide, then freeze-drying the remaining pure cellulose. An an insulator, deflected heat travels to the end of the wood fiber, where it can be released in the summer or retained in the winter.<br><br>

              <!-- https://umdrightnow.umd.edu/news/umd-researchers-create-super-wood-stronger-most-metals -->
              Super wood is created by hot compression after chemically removing lignin from soft woods like pine or balsa, which grow fast and are more environmentally friendly. The process can replace slower-growing but denser woods like teak, in furniture or buildings.<br><br>

              Infused with polymers and sturdier than traditional wood, transparent wood can be used in place of less environmentally friendly materials, such as plastics.

    <a href="../projects/rail/">Rubber and Composite Railroad Ties</a><br>
    Creosote-coated ties are a well known carcinogen, yet they remain in wide use in the railroad industry, despite being banned for consumer&nbsp;use. 
    In contrast, all-rubber railroad ties made from recycled car tire rubber last several times longer, and can be continually recycled into new railroad ties. They reduce sound and vibrations, and permanently capture carbon, unlike cement railroad ties which release carbon dioxide from limestone during production.<br><br>
    
    <a href="http://hansentie.com/">Turning Tires into Railroad Ties</a><br>
    80% of tires end up in landfills. The Hansen rubber railroad tie utilizes 68,000 recycled tires per mile (21 tires per railroad tie). All-rubber railroad ties are 100% recyclable into new rubber railroad ties or other crumb rubber products.
