<h1>Mass Timber Construction</h1>

<p>
While steel and concrete construction release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, wood traps and stores carbon.

<p>
	Mass timber, unlike the wood used in stick-built residential construction, 
	is more fire resistant than steel, with 30% the weight.
</p>

<h2>Four Categories of Mass Timber</h2>

<p>
1. <a href="https://www.smartlam.com/">Cross Laminated Timber (CLT)</a> - Layers of timber (lamellas) glued together with grain alternating at 90 degree angles. 

SmartLam, with a location in Alabama, was the first commercial Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) manufacturer in the U.S.  Their work includes the Tacoma Washington Train Station.   
<!--The Tacoma Washington Train station uses Douglas Fir glulam beams.  -->
</p>

<p>
2. <a href="https://www.rubner.com/en/holzbau/solutions/glulam-structures/">Glue Laminated Timber (Glulam)</a> - Larger and longer beams and columns are produced by layering laminates with the grain aligned. Samples by Rubner Holzbau in Europe.
</p>

<p>
3. <a href="https://structurecraft.com/materials/mass-timber/nail-laminated-timber">Nail Laminated Timber (NLT)</a> at the <a href="https://gfagrow.org/timber-in-georgias-first-living-building/">Kendeda Living Building at Georgia Tech</a>.
<!--
Companies are phasing out production of NLT in favor of Dowel Laminated Timber (DLT), a higher quality and more versatile mass timber product that is all wood.
-->
</p>

<p>
4. <a href="https://structurecraft.com/materials/mass-timber/dlt-dowel-laminated-timber">Dowel Laminated Timber (DLT)</a> - No glue, no nails, easy reuse. Also called DowelLam and Dübelholz (“Dowelled Wood”).
</p>

<p>
"DLT panels are made from softwood lumber boards stacked like the boards of NLT, but friction-fit together with hardwood dowels instead of nails. The dowels hold each board side-by-side, forming a stiffer and stronger connection than the nails in NLT. Each board lamination in a DLT panel is finger-jointed, creating a stiffer and stronger panel than NLT as it eliminates the board splices and butt-joints which are characteristic of NLT.
DLT panels may be processed using mill machinery, unlike NLT panels due to the nails. This creates a high tolerance panel which can also contain pre-integrated electrical conduit and other service runs." <a href="http://www.wooddesignandbuilding.com/dowel-laminated-timber/">more</a>
</p>

<p>
Timber and CLT components should be located on a suitable damp proof course membrane (DPC) at a minimum of 150mm above finished ground level unless a solution using an active drainage system is provided to reduce the distance.
