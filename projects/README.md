Projects use the EPA's [Environmentally-Extended Input Output widgets](https://model.earth/io/charts) 
to explore impacts at <a href="../../localsite/info/#show=brigades">US Brigade Cities</a><br>

## I. React - Select Goods and Services for carbon footprints

Edit Code for America's [publiccode-pusher](https://github.com/codeforamerica/publiccode-pusher) to save selected Goods and Services to GitHub. Saved list will be used for Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of company and individual carbon footprints.  

[View Interface - Italy](https://publiccode-editor.developers.italia.it/) - Best interface example currently  
[View Interface - America](https://codeforamerica.github.io/publiccode-pusher/) - Initial login requirement to be [removed](https://github.com/codeforamerica/publiccode-pusher/issues/13)  

1. Add a Goods and Services section and include an "Add" button for choosing sectors.
1. Pull the list of sectors from the [sectors.json file](https://github.com/modelearth/io/tree/master/build/api/USEEIOv2.0) in the built USEEIO-widgets repo used by the [io widgets](https://model.earth/io/charts/).
1. Include a field beside each selected sectors for the dollar/euro amounts per year.  
1. Save the list to the GitHub Repo either in the publiccode.yml or a separate sectors.yml file.  
1. Include a field for setting the year and save prior years as sectors-2020.yml.  

More about Code for America's [Public Code Pusher](https://brigade.cloud/projects/publiccode-helper/).

## II. Tools for Static Site Generation / GitHub Actions Automation


Create a node script that pulls 3 repos (localsite, io and apps) into one "webroot" repo.  

Add a GitHub Action that updates our [Farm Fresh data pull](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/python/farmfresh) nightly.  

Update map.js to include a choropleth map layer with industry density for [show=vehicles](../../localsite/info/#show=vehicles) to represent <a href="mobility/">locations potentially impacted by the transition to EV</a>. See [choropleth map samples](../start/maps/).   

Activate a legend in the map.js file. Place checkboxes before legend items to filter the map points and list below the map.  

Add mockups of integrated interfaces for Department of Labor tools like the [Georgia Labor Market Explorer](https://explorer.gdol.ga.gov/vosnet/Logoff.aspx?Displayonly=1&utype=L&plang=E)  

Output [All the Places](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/) into zip folders in our [zip/io/data repo](https://model.earth/zip/io/)<!-- generated by Kathryn Winglee. -->.

Update county [data prep scripts](../../localsite/info/data/) to include zip codes. Get latest from summer intern John Taylor.  

Find a source of "regions within states" based on sets of counties. Apply to [region_select dropdown](../../localsite/info/#state=GA).  

Move items above into our [Beyond Carbon Project Board](https://github.com/localsite/localsite/projects/1). See [Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7) examples.  
<!-- Project created from Automated kanban with reviews template. -->

DONE - Akilah assisted displaying the [Beyond Carbon](../../apps/beyondcarbon/) state results as a table with state names.  

DONE - Kathryn generated state dropdown script from [R-Language script](../../community-data/us/) to include lat/lon attributes for the [brigade map zoom](../../localsite/info/#show=industries&layers=brigades).  

DONE - Kathryn created files for all US zip codes.  She used the [uszipcode programmable database (Python)](https://uszipcode.readthedocs.io/01-Tutorial/index.html) - [Github](https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/uszipcode-project) to generate [a data file for each zip code](https://model.earth/zip/io/#zip=30310). Here's the [processing script](https://github.com/modelearth/zip/tree/master/io).



<!--
DONE - Pull Data to GitHub. Abrie fixed the [Vaccine dosage pull to GitHub](https://github.com/bbrewington/ga.dph.data/pull/1), now we need to [push into a Google Sheet](https://www.google.com/search?q=Github+Actions+send+data+to+Google+Sheet&oq=Github+A[…]et&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.20842j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).  


Generate static files to drive Data Commons navigation. Crosswalk zipcodes and counties to PUMA regions. This crosswalk resides in DataUSA.io Github repo. 

1. Contribute to our [AWS Amplify React](../aws/amplify/) repo by activating [Last Airbender indicator sets](../../io/charts/inflow-outflow/).  


1. Update EPA's <a href="../../io/charts/">Embeddable IO Widgets</a> generated from [USEEIO API](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API) local .json data.  
-->
<!--Auto-select all categories in center column when populated from naics values.-->

## IV. Python Projects

Great for Data Science and Computer Science Students  

### Python, Javascript, Leaflet Maps

We're creating a Python pipeline and Github Actions to add support for map layers with 30,000+ records, similar to Hack for LA's [Public Tree Map](https://neighborhood.org/public-tree-map/).  Start by triggering our [FarmFresh Python](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/python/farmfresh) data pull from the [community-data repo pipeline](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/).    

Predicting outcomes from changes to collections of industries and transitions within industry groups.  [NAICS Data processing](../../localsite/info/data/flowsa/) / [Python cheatsheet](https://github.com/gto76/python-cheatsheet)


COLAB-orating with San Diego: [mcmorgan27/sd-business](https://github.com/mcmorgan27/sd-business/tree/1b22ef0e9231f0d2bcfafcff41e69c9adc9038fd)

Sample of embedded [Choropleth Map for Entire Automotive Industry](https://model.earth/localsite/info/#show=vehicles&indicators=VADD&naics=326199,336390,325211,326112,336412,333111,336211,336340,336370,336413,336320,335911,336360,331110,335912,331221,336111,336330&count=20) using DataUSA.io widget displaying American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample [PUMS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata/mdat.html) data.  
<!--
1. Finalize csv output for counties by state using [BLS data from EPA Flowsa](/localsite/info/data/) - scroll down in page.  Merge columns and save in state folders.  
-->
1. [Set-up Flask server](/localsite/info/data/datacommons/) using DataCommon.org website repo sample. Deploy to Google hosting.  

1. Document setting up a public website using the Machine Learning Websocket in the [impact map](/io/impact/)  project sample.

1. Create cool map output with code from our existing Machine Learning projects:  
- [Impact map (Machine Learning Websocket)](/io/impact/) - We'd love to get this running on Google Cloud, Heroku or AWS. Or convert to a fully static site.  
- [JS clustering (Machine Learning Javascript)](/community/zip/leaflet/#columns=JobsAgriculture:50;JobsManufacturing:50) - To add to our localsite/js/map.js file
- [Simple Choropleth](/community/map/income/) and [More Map Samples](/community/start/maps/)


<!--
1. Contribute a USSEIO Widget to the [DataUSA.io](https://datausa.io/) GitHub repos.

1. Test output normalization for [Sankey chart](../../io/charts/sankey/) using the [USEEIO API Examples](/community/resources/useeio/)

1. Expand upon [county-based results](../../localsite/info/) to provide zipcode-based industry lists. - [Details](industries) 

1. Create and update scripts that pull data and pre-process into csv and json files for [industry zip code searches](industries/) and [local commodity searchs](/localsite/info/data/).  

1. Industry Level Estimates for Counties and Zipcodes. Fill in gaps when only the number of establishments is provided at the state level - [Details](../../localsite/info/data/)  

1. Update CSV files on employment and industries for D3 charts using [Census industry data](industries) and [income by zipcode (zcta)](prep/all). 
-->
<!--[projections](prep/regression/)-->

<!--
1. Work with the [USEEIO API](https://github.com/usepa/useeio_api/wiki/Use-the-API) and update [Input-Output charts](../../io/charts/). Widgets are loaded from JSON files generated from the [USEEIO API endpoints](https://s3.amazonaws.com/useeio-api-go-swagger-staging/index.html) on AWS for Goods & Services demand vectors (Food System and Full System).  

1. Update [Django Census Reporter](resources/censusreporter) by staring with the Python 3 Wazimap [fork](resources/censusreporter) used in Africa and India. Integrate US demographic data from Python 2 version. Set up Docker to [deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/datamade/how-to/blob/master/heroku/deploy-a-django-app.md) using a [containerization template](https://github.com/datamade/how-to/tree/master/docker/templates). Learn more [about using Heroku or AWS](https://datamade.us/blog/why-were-switching-to-heroku/).  
-->

## V. Dive into Google Data Commons API

[Install Data Commons Lite](../../localsite/info/data/datacommons/) on your local computer.  

Find and pull US census data by state and county from the Google Data Commons API.  Look for commute times.  

Pull Walkability data from one of the free API's services that provide Walk Scores, Transit Scores and Bike Scores: [RapidAPI.com](https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/walk-score/details) or [WalkScore.com](https://www.walkscore.com/professional/api.php)  

Add an "[Environment > Impact](https://datacommons.org/place/country/USA?topic=Environment)" section to Google Data commons using the [EPA IO Widgets](../../io/charts/).  

Use and improve the Google Data Common's checkbox heirarchy - [sample](https://datacommons.org/tools/timeline#place=zip%2F30318&statsVar=Count_Person_5To17Years_BornInOtherStateInTheUnitedStates%2C0%2C6%2C1%2C1%2C0__Count_Person_60To61Years_BornInOtherStateInTheUnitedStates%2C0%2C6%2C7%2C1%2C0%2CCount_Person__Count_Person_5To17Years_BornInStateOfResidence%2C0%2C6%2C1%2C1%2C1__WagesAnnual_Establishment%2C9%2C0__Count_Establishment%2C9%2C2&chart=%7B%22count%22%3A%7B%22pc%22%3Afalse%7D%7D)  

Add highlighted colors similar to BEA  
[View sample](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=150&step=3&isuri=1&table_list=5013&categories=compbyind), click Table > Bar Chart and choose industries.  

Analysis applied to <a href="projects/mobility/">industries impacted by the transition to EV</a>.  

<!--
Find existing widgets and repos that use the [Charging Station API](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC). Perhaps the [Open Charge Map API](https://openchargemap.org/site/develop/api) and/or [TomTom](https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api-documentation/ev-charging-stations-availability).
--> 

## VI. Crowdsource Editor - Google REST App

1. Google Sheet Crowdsource Editor - A REST process allowing editors to return and update their own row contributions.

1. Work with a [JAMstack Editor](https://headlesscms.org/) to edit CSV files directly on GitHub using social logins. 

1. [Google Sheet Editor](https://model.earth/editor) for crowdsourcing updates. Code for America Brigades often use Google Sheets to maintain directories, like these maps: [Georgia](https://www.georgia.org/covid19suppliersmap) and [North Carolina](https://nccovidsupport.org/). A social login process is needed to allow contributors to return and update their own Google sheet row data through an online form, without having access to edit rows of other contributors. The set-up needs to take only a minute per sheet, so avoid Zapier or other time-intensive approaches.


## VII. React - Input-Output Sankey Chart

1. Update the [Sankey D3 Chart](../../io/charts/sankey/) data formatting to use the same process as the [USEEIO inflow-outflow widget](../../io/build/slider.html#sectors=333613,335912,336111&page=1&count=10).  

1. View info on [editing EPA IO widgets](/io/charts/).

1. See sample [visualizations](../start/charts/) of material flow charts.

1. Normalization input and output so sides of Sankey are even.

<!--
And/or <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/">Apollo</a> GraphQL for faster dev than the point-to-point nature of REST endpoints.  
-->



## VIII. .NET Core 5.0 Team

1. Create a "Disposable Database" for editing crowdsourced lists using .csv files hosted in GitHub, Google Sheets, AirTables and/or Azure.  Document your REST process using a [RealWorld example page](https://neighborhood.org/realworld) to integrate frontend and backend tools.  

1. Add USEEIO widgets to [.NET Environmental Education tools](https://model.earth/setup/) for GEEP partner states and countries.
