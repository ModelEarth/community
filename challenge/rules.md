### Code for Atlanta Projects  

Slack #epa

<b>1. Teams</b>: Brainstorm Projects - [Review maps and charts](tools/), [Review inventory exchange](tools/#places)   

<b>2. GitHub</b>: Experiment with [GitHub Packages](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/about-github-packages#supported-clients-and-formats)  
  Is it possible to pull just the [community](https://github.com/datascape/community) "tools" folder into [model.georgia](https://github.com/datascape/model.georgia) repo?   

<b>3. Leaflet</b>: [Place a round image](https://github.com/ilyankou/Leaflet.IconMaterial/issues/3) over a [Leaflet.IconMaterial](https://github.com/ilyankou/Leaflet.IconMaterial) map point, which allows for color assignment. [Test here](/community/hubs).

### Volunteer Projects

We need assistance pre-processing lat/lon centers for zip codes, cities and counties - for all states (and countries).  

We'll use these for the [Farm Fresh Produce Map location filters](impact/?show=farmfresh&design=1) which are also used for Covid-19 supply maps.
