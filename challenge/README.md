Form a team, join an existing team or compete individually in our 2020 virtual events presented by the U.S. EPA in partnership with the Georgia Department of Economic Development and <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/" target="_parent" style="white-space: nowrap;">Code for America</a>. You can compete from anywhere in the world!   

We're combining national and state-level economic data, community resources and planning input from local communities to customize new environmental indicator models to meet&nbsp;community&nbsp;needs. International trade components using Harmonized System (HS) codes are also encouraged.  

We'll be using the new environmentally-extended input-output model called 
<a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=336332" target="_blank">USEEIO</a> developed by the <a href="https://www.epa.gov" target="_parent">US Environmental Protection Agency&nbsp;(EPA)</a>. 

<!--
	We're looking for communities, companies and coders to participate in implementing innovative sustainability apps created in partnership with the <a href="https://www.epa.gov" target="_parent">US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>.
