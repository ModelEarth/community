Our innovative new tools provide information on the potential environmental and economic outcomes of changes that effect goods and services produced and consumed within a community.<br><br>

The U.S. EPA and the Georgia Deptartment of Economic Development, with the help of Georgia Tech Smart Community Corp interns and Code for America volunteers, have developed web-based tools that report the environmental and economic impact of industries in both local communities, state regions and the entire US using 24 indicators, including jobs, value-added, air quality, climate impact, energy use, water use and land use. These tools use the US EPA’s premier model for estimating environmental profiles of industries and goods and services that embody a life cycle perspective called USEEIO. They are coupled with local employment, industry, and geographic data to provide more community-specific insight.<br><br>
