#How to Create a Winning Entry

##Start early and recruit talent for your team

Encourage team members to register by providing them with the following link:  
[https://model.earth/community/challenge](https://model.earth/community/challenge)  

##Fork repos and copy one of the community page examples

Get started by forking 3 repos (localsite, io, apps) into one site webroot. [How to fork repos](../../../localsite/start/)  
Copy the [base folder](../../../apps/base/) within the [apps repo](../../../apps/) and change variables to match your local community.  
 

##Identify a location and explore adverse impacts affecting your area

Use the USEEIO [industry comparison page](https://model.earth/localsite/info/) to identify an issue that relates to your location.  

Choose a state, then choose one or more counties to narrow your search.  

Example: When exploring our city's impact, we saw that the airport was a chief offender. We recognized that our neighborhood's local wastewater was processed near the airport, so we decided to investigate converting "Shit to Fuel" to eliminate the dependency on fossil fuels.  We are looking at Australia for inspiration since their experimental wastewater plant also generates graphene to capture additional carbon.

##Contact local reps who are involved with your issue

Include documentation in your app regarding the prime local movers (influencers) for your issue. Include government reps and nonprofit organizers. Reach out to them in advance of the event to get additional insights for your documentation. If you can't contact them because it is the weekend of the event, find other links to document the local steps needed to make your vision a reality.  

##Select top indicators from the EPA's 20 environmental areas

Choose 1 to 10 environmental impact indicators that match your theme.  

For example, clicking the "Air" button on the industry comparison page returns:  
[set=air&indicators=GHG,GCC,MGHG,OGHG,HRSP,OZON,SMOG,HAPS](../../../localsite/info/#set=air&indicators=GHG,GCC,MGHG,OGHG,HRSP,OZON,SMOG,HAPS)

Paste the values from the URL hash into your [Community App](../../../apps/) portal page.  

Your indicators you pre-select will determine the order of the commodity sectors listed on your portal page.  

##Weigh the pros and cons of new innovation for your community

Consider including the positive indicators JOBS and VADD (value-added) to identify which industries contribute the most to prosperity.  

##Prepare code and data processes that contribute to the tools used by other teams.

Contributing new sharable code and data processes will help set your team apart and qualify for the larger awards.  
Check out the [Project Areas](../../../community/projects/) page for ideas, or create your own custom additions to the [USEEIO widgets code base](../../../io/charts/).  
Integrate existing code from other open source projects in ways that can be reused by other communities.  

##Get started early and attend a meetup if you have any questions.
