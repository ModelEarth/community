Join us to create tools and industry maps for Sustainable Material Management (smm) using Google [Data Commons](https://datacommons.org) in our <a href="meetups/" style="white-space:nowrap;">Weekly Meetups</a>.  

Get started with our [Data Commons Lite setup steps](../../localsite/info/data/datacommons/)

We're using Google Data Commons and [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/data/) data to relate USEPA indicators to counties and regions, with a focus on:  

- <a href="../../../localsite/info/#showloc">Industries and Impacts by county</a>  
- [Solar Companies](../../localsite/map/#show=solar)  
- [Recycling, Processors, Transfer Stations](../../localsite/map/recycling/ga/)   
- [Electric Vehicle Ecosystems](../../localsite/info/#state=GA&show=vehicles)  
- [Commute Times and Walkability](../../localsite/info/data/)

<b>EV Challenge Statements</b>  

1. Where are concentrations of electric and hydrogen vehicle parts manufacturers emerging?  

2. Where are combustion vehicle manufacturers likely to be impacted?  

3. How can we improve the visualization of supply chain inflow and outflow for local impacts on jobs, value added and the environment?

<h3>Areas of Focus</h3>


<!--
County automobile industry employment for 6-digit NAICS 336111.
4-digit NAICS resides in "By-Industry" link [here](https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm), but we will be pulling from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)&nbsp;API.  
-->

We'll be displaying Jobs and Value Added using <a href="../../io/charts/inflow-outflow/#indicators=VADD,JOBS">impact filters</a>  

We'll be creating a choropleth map of 
<a href="../projects/mobility/">industries impacted by the transition to EV</a>  

We'll be dreaming of creating an integrated [Georgia Labor Market Explorer](https://explorer.gdol.ga.gov/vosnet/Logoff.aspx?Displayonly=1&utype=L&plang=E)
