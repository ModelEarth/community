<h3>Areas of Focus</h3>

<a href="../../../localsite/info/#go=parts&show=counties">Parts manufacturing industries by county</a>  
County automobile industry employment for 6-digit NAICS 336111.
4-digit NAICS resides in "By-Industry" link [here](https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm), but we will be pulling from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)&nbsp;API.  


We'll be creating a choropleth map of 
<a href="../projects/mobility/">industries impacted by transition to EV</a><br>

We'll be displaying Added Value and Jobs using <a href="../../io/charts/inflow-outflow/#indicators=VADD,JOBS">filters</a> for EV Production.
