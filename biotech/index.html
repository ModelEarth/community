Production of fuels and chemicals from biomass can potentially support rural economies and support economic development with low environmental impact.​
</p>

<p>
The USDA is sponsoring a research project involving researchers at Northwestern University, University of South Florida, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and LanzaTech, on technology for production of fuels and chemicals from biomass using <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/03/f61/Engineered%20reversal%20of%20the%20beta%20oxidation%20cycle%20in%20clostridia%20for%20the%20synthesis%20of%20fuels%20and%20chemicals_EE0008354.pdf">reversal of the β-oxidation cycle</a> This specific technology could produce, for example, components for plastics made from wood waste rather than from natural gas or petroleum.​
</p>

<p>
We are interested in conversations with stakeholders, to hear about the issues that matter to community members, to environmental advocates, and to people working all along the supply chain of fuel and chemical production in the southeast.
</p>

<p style="display:none">
  We will have a stakeholders meeting on March 3 at the Georgia Tech Renewable Bioproducts Institute and we welcome participation.​

<br>
-->

<!--
One idea: Carbon retention level could reside in the extended NAICS values as a range of 000 to 100, and up to 999 on a logrithmic scale for net-positive technologies that absorb surrounding carbon.  Example: A syngas production tech would start with 325120 for “Industrial Gas Manufacturing.” Then we could add three digits for the subtype of the industry (so randomly 0233 for non-thermal syngas production), followed by 000 to 999 for the level of carbon capture. Resulting in: 325120.0233.000 for a process that releases carbon monoxide into the air. If a technology captures carbon from the surrounding environment, the net-positive value could increase the carbon capture indicator beyond 100.<br><br>

	<!--Professor Yongsheng Chen<br>-->
	"The proposed anaerobic membrane biological treatment process will transfer organic contaminants into biogas and remove pathogens such as E. coli to ensure food safety, but the nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, for example) will remain. By using a smart membrane or nanomaterials to extract trace contaminants like endocrine disruptors, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals, the nutrients that are left can be pumped through a vertical hydroponic system to grow produce without adding fertilizer. The project will monitor water and produce quality and measure contamination from chemicals and microbes continuously."

	PRISM<sup style="font-size:.5em">TM</sup> uses low temperature plasma to produce clean hydrogen-rich, process-ready syngas from any carbonaceous feedstock affordably at room temperature. 
	Using 60 to 100 watts to operate, the process eliminates intensive energy requirements while maintaining high conversion efficiency using Catalytic Partial Oxidation (CPOX).
	Less than 1% parasitic load. Greater than 98% CO/H2. 
	PRISM is exothermic so room temp natural gas is introduced and a near pure synthesis gas exits at around 800°c. -

	Conversion of biomass to syngas is typically low-yield.

The catalyst can be operated at atmospheric pressure and reduces char. The entire process is autothermic and therefore heating is not required.  Another process has been developed at DTU Energy which is efficient and does not have any issues of fouling of the catalyst (in this case a cerium oxide catalyst). - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngas">Source: wiki</a><br><br>

<h3>Bioeconomy Stage 3 (2030-2050):</h3>
<h1>Captured Biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> as Feedstock</h1>

Capturing CO<sub>2</sub> from biological sources and using it to produce algae, plastics, transport fuels, animal feed and other chemicals/materials will help reduce emissions in the second half of the 21st century. - <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/going-carbon-negative-what-are-the-technology-options">Going Carbon Negative</a><br><br>

Reusing captured biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> as a feedstock is an alternative to pumping it underground into rock formations. 
Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) has been tested at industrial scale in the U.S. to store carbon in sandstone at the Archer Daniels Midland (<a href="https://investigatemidwest.org/2020/11/19/despite-hundreds-of-millions-in-tax-dollars-adms-carbon-capture-program-still-hasnt-met-promised-goals/">ADM</a>) bioethanol plant.<br><br>

Whether using as a feedstock or pumping into rock formations, the process of capturing carbon from flue gas with CO<sub>2</sub> levels of 10%, is more bountiful than Direct Air Capture (DAC) since atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels are only 0.04%.<br><br>
